## Architecture Lock

> ⚠️ These decisions are locked. Agents must enforce them every session.
> To change architecture decisions, re-run `vibe-guard-init`. Do not edit this block manually.

### Locked Decisions

| Decision         | Choice                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Framework        | React                         |
| Styling          | Tailwind CSS                  |
| State Management | Zustand                       |
| File Structure   | feature-based (group by feature) |
| Testing          | Vitest                        |

### Agent Rules

1. **Framework** — All UI code must use **React**. Do not introduce other frameworks or alternative rendering approaches.
2. **Styling** — All styles must use **Tailwind CSS**. Do not add inline styles, alternative CSS solutions, or mixing of styling methods unless the locked choice is already mixed.
3. **State Management** — Follow **Zustand**. Do not add global state libraries not listed here. Do not suggest migrations.
4. **File Structure** — Organize new files using **feature-based (group by feature)** convention. Do not restructure existing files without explicit instruction.
5. **Testing** — Write tests using **Vitest**. Do not add test files using a different framework.

### Enforcement

- If asked to deviate from any locked decision, refuse and explain the lock.
- If you believe a locked decision is wrong for the task, flag it for human review — do not silently change it.
- These rules supersede general best-practice suggestions. The human locked these intentionally.
